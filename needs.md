## These are things that it would be nice if `bevy_ui` provided

- Scrolling container
- Input component
- Borders (appears there in an example, wtf am I doing wrong?)
- Focus model / events
- Move Interaction::Clicked to Release not Press (or have both available)
- Interaction::DoubleClicked
- Backward Ordering
- Text decoration (underline)
- Animation
