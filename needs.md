## These are things that it would be nice if `bevy_ui` provided

### Bugs

- ~~https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/328 - Most of the material swapping issues are coming from things~~
- https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/351 - Most of the layout issues are due to this

  - this also causes crashing bugs when hiding the main body or sometimes when deleting an individual todo_row

### Enhancements

- Scrolling container
- Input component
- display: `hide`
- Borders (appears there in an example, wtf am I doing wrong?)
- Focus model / events
- Move Interaction::Clicked to Release not Press (or have both available)
- Interaction::DoubleClicked
- Backward Ordering
- Text decoration (underline)
- Animation
